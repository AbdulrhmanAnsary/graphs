# Graph Algorithms in C++

This repository contains implementations of various graph algorithms using C++. The code is designed to handle graphs with different characteristics, including  undirected, unweighted graphs.

## Features

- **Graph Representation:**
  - Adjacency List
  - Adjacency Matrix (if applicable)
- **A different implamentation for graphs**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler such as `g++` or `clang++`.
- Basic understanding of C++ programming and data structures.

### Compiling the Code

To compile any of the graph algorithms, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o graph_algorithm graph_algorithm.cpp
```

Replace graph_algorithm.cpp with the name of the C++ file you wish to compile. The -std=c++17 flag ensures compatibility with C++17 standards, which is required for some features.

Running the Executable
After compiling the code, you can run the generated executable:

```bash
./graph_algorithm
```
